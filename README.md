# InstaKill — Starter Repo

Mini social-media platform. Mandatory backend: Python + FastAPI + SQLite (default) / PostgreSQL (allowed). See the full brief and grading rubric in `masterplan.md` (course root).

What the instructor provides (this starter):

- `app/main.py` — FastAPI hello-world with `GET /health`
- `app/db/database.py` — SQLite bootstrap (creates tables on startup)
- `app/domain/models.py` — `User` / `Post` schema
- `scripts/seed_db.py` — 5-10 synthetic users/posts
- `tests/test_health.py` — test skeleton

What it does **not** provide: the feed, ranking, ML models, search. Those are the team's work, in the following weeks.

## Running it

```bash
pip install -e .
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# other terminal:
curl localhost:8000/health

python scripts/seed_db.py
pytest
```

## Milestones (see masterplan.md for full details)

W1 Repo+API → W3 CRUD+DB → W4 Feed v0 → W7 Baseline+eval plan → W9 ML+pretrained feature → W11 Profile+optimize → W13 Feature freeze+E2E → W14 Red-team+Demo Day.

At the end of each week: a demonstrable commit/tag.

## Feed Complexity (Week 4)
- **Big-O per request:** One `GET /feed` request runs in $O(C \log k)$ time, where $C$ is the number of candidates and $k$ is the limit. This is achieved by utilizing a min-heap (`heapq.nsmallest`) to maintain only the top-$k$ scored posts without fully sorting all candidates.
- **Precomputation:** To scale further, freshness and popularity signals (which do not depend on the specific user) can be precomputed or cached periodically per post rather than computed dynamically on every request.
